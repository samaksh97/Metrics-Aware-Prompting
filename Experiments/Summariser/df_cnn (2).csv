With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.","Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .
U.S consumer advisory group says minimum space must be stipulated .
Safety tests conducted on planes with more leg room than airlines offer ."," The key points of the article are:

1. The space on airplanes is becoming smaller and more cramped, which is causing discomfort and potential health and safety risks for passengers.
2. A U.S consumer advisory group has criticized the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for not setting minimum space standards for human passengers, while there are standards for animals on planes.
3. The FAA conducts tests on how quickly passengers can evacuate a plane, but these tests use planes with a 31-inch pitch, a standard that has decreased on some airlines.
4. The distance between two rows of seats, known as the pitch, varies among airlines. Some airlines, such as United Airlines, Gulf Air, Air Asia, and Spirit Airlines, offer less than 31 inches of pitch, while British Airways, easyJet, Thomson, and Virgin Atlantic offer 31 inches or more.
5. The decreased space on planes can lead to issues such as fighting for space in overhead lockers, crashing elbows, and seat back kicking, and potentially more serious problems."," * The amount of personal space on airplanes has been decreasing, leading to discomfort and potential health and safety risks for passengers.
* A U.S consumer advisory group has criticized the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for not setting minimum space standards for human passengers, while such standards exist for animals on planes.
* The FAA conducts tests on how quickly passengers can evacuate a plane, but these tests use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard that has decreased on some airlines.
* Some airlines, such as United Airlines, Gulf Air, Air Asia, and Spirit Airlines, offer as little as 28-30 inches of pitch in economy class, compared to 31 inches on British Airways and 30-31 inches on Virgin Atlantic.
* The decreased space on planes can lead to conflicts over overhead locker space, elbow room, and seat back kicking, and may also have more serious consequences in emergency situations."," Summary:

Recent concerns have been raised about the decreasing space between airplane seats and its potential impact on passenger health and safety. While the government has set standards for animal welfare during flights, there are currently no regulations specifying a minimum amount of space for human passengers. This issue is particularly relevant as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducts tests on evacuation procedures using planes with a 31-inch pitch, a standard that some airlines have already decreased.

Major airlines like United Airlines offer as little as 30 inches, while Gulf Air, Air Asia, and Spirit Airlines provide 29 inches or less. European airlines such as British Airways, easyJet, Thomson, and Virgin Atlantic also offer varying seat pitches between 28 and 31 inches. The decrease in space might lead to more severe consequences than just discomfort, such as restricting emergency evacuation times and increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Risks:
1. Slower emergency evacuations due to reduced personal space.
2. Increased risk of health issues, including deep vein thrombosis.

Governmental Responses:
The Department of Transportation and FAA have not yet established minimum space requirements for human passengers. However, consumer advocate Charlie Leocha has called for the DOT and FAA to address this issue and ensure humane treatment for air travelers."

A zoo spokesman said: 'Guards had earlier spotted him close to the enclosure but had no idea he was planing to enter it. 'Fortunately, there are eight moats to cross before getting to where the lions usually are and he fell into the second one, allowing guards to catch up with him and take him out. 'We then handed him over to the police.' Brave fool: Fortunately, Mr Kumar  fell into a moat as he ran towards the lions and could be rescued by zoo security staff before reaching the animals (stock image) Kumar later explained: 'I don't really know why I did it. 'I was drunk and thought I'd stand a good chance.' A police spokesman said: 'He has been cautioned and will be sent for psychiatric evaluation. 'Fortunately for him, the lions were asleep and the zoo guards acted quickly enough to prevent a tragedy similar to that in Delhi.'

Mr. Kumar, 17, surprised zoo security by jumping over the enclosure fence and running towards the lions while intoxicated. He fell into a moat, which allowed guards to rescue him before he reached the animals.

Potential Risks:
- Direct threat to both the drunk teenager and the zoo animals due to the intrusion.
- Possibility of panic among animals, potentially leading to aggressive behavior and injury.
- Negative impact on the zoo's reputation and safety measures.

Governmental Responses:
- Police involvement, with the teenager being handed over to them after the incident.
- A police spokesman mentioned that Mr. Kumar will undergo a psychiatric evaluation and has been cautioned.

The incident highlights the importance of strict security measures and the consequences of alcohol consumption affecting decision-making abilities. This case also shows the need for mental health evaluations when individuals engage in dangerous behavior. This particular zoo has a series of moats around the lions' enclosure that prevented a potential tragedy, but not all zoos might have such protective measures in place."

4,3da746a7d9afcaa659088c8366ef6347fe6b53ea,"Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.","Tell-all interview with the reality TV star, 69, will air on Friday April 24 .
